<h2>Last-Step Shortest Path Overview</h2>
<p>For each polygon P, we divide the entire plane into regions, one region for each edge and vertex of P.  To get to any point p in the plane, we can figure out which region it is in.  This tells us the shortest way of getting to p by first visiting P.</p>
<p>So here's the plan: we compute the last-step shortest path regions for our first polygon.  Then, we move to our second polygon, and find the shortest path for each of its vertices.  This gives us the last-step shortest path for the second polygon.  We use this to compute the map for each subsequent polygon.</p>
<p>When we have all of these maps, we can then find the shortest path to any query point.  We find out where it is in the last map, which tells where we have to come from on the last polygon.  Then we move backwards, looking at where this point lies in the previous shortest path map.  We keep moving back until we have found the points to touch in all polygons.  All that is left is to connect the dots into a path</p>
