<h2>The Parts Cutting Problem Overview</h2>
<p>We have a large sheet of plastic, and a laser head that can move across it.  We want to cut out shapes from the plastic, and we want to do it fast: we want the laser head to travel the minimum possible distance to get to each of the polygons and cut them out.</p>
<p>The Parts Cutting Problem is a specific form of the Touring Polygons Problem, in which a path must be constructed to visit a sequence of polygons in the minimum distance under various constraints.  There are two important restrictions in this problem.
<ul>
    <li>The order in which the polygons should be visited must be part of the input - otherwise the problem is as hard as the NP-Hard Travelling Salesperson Problem.</li>
    <li>The polygons must be convex.</li>
    <li>The polygons should not intersect, though they can contain one another.</li>
</ul></p>
