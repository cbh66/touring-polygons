<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
<p>We suppose there are <span class="math">k</span> polygons with a total of <span class="math">n</span> vertices.  <span class="math">k</span>, of course, must be between <span class="math">0</span> and <span class="math">n/3</span>.</p>
<p>The algorithm constructs k maps (one for each polygon).  To make a map, the shortest path to each vertex must be computed.  Therefore, the algorithm requires a shortest-path query for each vertex, so the total time taken is <span class="math">O(n)</span> times the time to compute a single shortest path.</p>
<p>Given the maps for preceding polygons, a shortest-path query requires figuring out which region the point is in.  The regions can be stored in a point-location structure supporting logarithmic-time lookup.  For polygon <span class="math">i</span> with <span class="math">|P_i|</span> vertices, there are <span class="math">O(|P_i|)</span> regions.  Hence, figuring out which region a point is in takes <span class="math">O(log(|P_i|))</span> time for the <span class="math">i</span>'th map.</p>
<p>Building a path potentially requires going backwards and making a query for the maps of all previous polygons.  Therefore, the total time to compute a shortest path is a sum, for each polygon <span class="math">P_i</span> with <span class="math">|P_i|</span> vertices, of <span class="math">O(log(|P_i|)</span>, which is maximized when every polygon has <span class="math">O(n/k)</span> vertices.  As there are <span class="math">k</span> polygons, this gives a total of <span class="math">O(k log(n/k))</span> for a single shortest-path query.</p>
<p>Since the algorithm makes <span class="math">O(n)</span> such queries, the overall time complexity is <span class="math">O(kn log(n/k))</span>.  Depending on the value of <span class="math">k</span>, this could be as small as <span class="math">O(n logn)</span> (when <span class="math">k</span> is small) or as large as <span class="math">O(n^2)</span> (when <span class="math">k</span> is near <span class="math">n/3</span>).</p>
