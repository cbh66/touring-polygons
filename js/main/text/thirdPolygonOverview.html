<h2>Third Polygon</h2>
<p>We repeat our process.  Again, we use the previous map to construct the next one; we use it to compute the shortest path to each vertex of our polygon.</p>
<p>This way, each polygon's Last Step Shortest Path Map takes into account the maps of all of the previous polygons.</p>
