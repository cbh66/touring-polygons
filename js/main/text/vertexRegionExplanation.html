<h2>Vertex-Source Regions</h2>
<p>Finally, we have the red areas, regions for which a vertex is the source.  These are cones that fill in the rest of the plane.  As for edge-source regions, any path to these regions must detour to touch the polygon.  For these regions, the best place to touch the polygon is the associated vertex.  There is more leeway when bouncing off of a vertex than an edge: you can go off at any angle, bounded only by adjacent regions.</p>
<p>Imagining the starting point as a light source again, these regions show how light would scatter off the polygon at the corners.  The original paper calls this effect a starbust.</p>
<p>Having constructed the other regions, it's easy to make the vertex-source regions.  Take one bound from each adjacent region.  These become the bounds of this vertex's region.  Most of these will come from edges, but two vertices will be adjacent to the passthrough region; they will each have a bound that is a tangent line.</p>
