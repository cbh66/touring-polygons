<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Draw polygons to be cut out on the canvas.  The laser will start at the green point, visit each polygon in the order you created them, and end at the red point.</p>
<p>To make a new polygon, just click to make its first vertex.  Click again to add each new vertex, which will be connected with the previous one.  To close the polygon, click the starting vertex again.</p>
<p>Vertices can be dragged after they are placed.  The green starting point and the red ending point can also be dragged.  Polygons that aren't convex will be shaded red, and unless you fix them they will be ignored.</p>
<p>Once you've drawn some polygons, press the button below the canvas to start finding the shortest path.</p>
